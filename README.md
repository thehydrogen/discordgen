# discordgen
âœ¨ - Get started with Discord.js quickly!

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is required to use discordgen!

## Setup
First, install `discordgen` as a global package with npm
```
npm i -G discordgen
```

## Get started
You can first run `discordgen` to see all the available commands. Now, run `discordgen create` to start 
the process of setting up your new bot. Once you complete the setup process, run `discordgen configure` to start configuring your bot. Make sure you have a bot account ready before you run the configure command.

## Running the bot
Once you've completed setting up and configuring your bot, run it with `discordgen run`. This starts it with a PM2 process. If you don't want that, simply run it with `node .`
